Some ROS tutorial notes (from Tyler)

1) Using "rospack":
(Used to get information about packages)
Usage:		$ rospack [option] [package_name]
Example:	$ rospack find roscpp
Returns:	/opt/ros/kinetic/share/roscpp

2) Using "roscd" (part of the rosbash suite):
(Used to change directory directly to a package or stack)
Usage:		$ roscd [location_name[/subdir]]
Example:	$ roscd roscpp
Returns:	(Nothing, but when you 'pwd' you should see:/opt/ros/kinetic/share/roscpp)
Extra:		You may also run "roscd log" if you have run ROS programs before to see the logs that are generated.

3) Using "rosls" (part of the rosbash suite):
(Used to ls directly in a package by name rather than by an absolute path)
Usage:		$ rosls [location_name[/subdir]]
Example:	$ rosls roscpp_tutorials
Returns:	cmake launch package.xml srv			(<--this is a list of items in that directory)

4) "TAB" key autocomplete:
-When typing hit the "TAB" key once to autocomplete as your normally would
-If there are multiple items that end with what you are searching, hitting "TAB" again will display them all, without changing what you have on the command line

Example 1: 	$ roscd roscpp_tut<<<PRESS TAB KEY>>>
Returns:	(Nothing)
Terminal: 	$ roscd roscpp_tutorials/

Example 2:	$ roscd tur<<<PRESS TAB KEY>>>
Returns:	(Nothing)
Terminal:	$ roscd turtle

Example 3:	$ roscd turtle<<<PRESS TAB KEY>>>
Returns:	turtle_actionlib/ turtlesim/	turtle_tf/	(<-- list of directories starting with 'turtle')
Terminal:	$ roscd turtle					(<-- command line unaffected despite something being returned)
