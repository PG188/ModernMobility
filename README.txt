The objective of this project is to create a smart, semi-autonomous, medical walker. The lists below include the primary and secondary goals identified for this project. These goals are the anticipated features for the target user within this design project. 

Primary Goals
1. Modify a standard walker to autonomously drive itself away to a ‘station’ when the user no longer requires the walker. The walker can autonomously track, navigate, and move to the a predefined ‘stations’. 
2. User can remotely prompt the walker to return to them from the product’s current location. 
3. The walker will be capable of actively braking upon detecting any rapid changes in elevation. For example, if a steep slope, stairs, or a sudden drop in the ground is detected. 
4. Maintain the primary functionalities of the common medical walker while augmenting its functionality by adding features in line with the above goals.
