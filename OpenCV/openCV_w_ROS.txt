Intended use:

1)	When walker is in front of docking station a message* should be published to topic 'atDock'
2)	openCVNode will subscribe to 'atDock', when a message is received openCV code will run
3)	The code looks for a marker on the roof centered above the docking station
4)	Once found, the distance between the centre of the marker and the cenre of the camera's field of view is calculated
5)	The difference in pixels is published on two topics (one for the x direction and one for the y)
6)	The deltas indicate how far** in the x and y directions the walker still needs to move
7)	Once the walker has moved, repeat process from step 1 until deltas received are zero***

Notes

*	we'll use an integer value of 1 indicating we're at the docking station (0 otherwise)
**	We will determine how pixels and meters relate experimentally
***	Doesn't necessarily have to be zero, we'll likely need to have some tolerance
